Ebook

Investigatory repository - "I wonder if I can host an ebook as source in github?"

Background
==========
I have been working on the Ubuntu Ebook Template System, and I was thinking about how Ebooks could be shared.  The Ubuntu Template System uses lauchpad and the standard repository system of Linux to allow ebooks to be installed onto Ubuntu Devices, but I was hoping to look at alternatives to that, and this is what this ebook project is going to be all about.

Plan
====
I intend to take an ebook source (produced by the template) and push it to github, allowing me to investigate whether github would be a suitable mechanism for sharing ebook content.
